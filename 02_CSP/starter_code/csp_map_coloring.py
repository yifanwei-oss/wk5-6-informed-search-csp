Assignment starter: backtracking CSP solver for map colouring.

Read ../guide.md and ../worked_example.md BEFORE you start coding here.

Your job: fill in every function marked TODO. Do not change function
signatures (the tests in test_csp_map_coloring.py rely on them).

The problem: colour a map of Australia's 7 regions so that no two adjacent
regions share a colour, using only 3 colours.
